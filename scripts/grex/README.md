## Aggregation

# WIP

> From Latin aggregātus, perfect passive participle of aggregō (“I flock together”), from ag-, combining form of ad (“to, toward”), + gregō (“I flock or group”), from grex (“flock”). Compare gregarious.

I think [we may need to develop a distributed method of address aggregation](http://transitiontech.ca/cjdns/aggregate). This directory will contain scripts for doing just that.

To get an idea about how subtle metrics can affect thresholds and equilibria in simulated spaces, read [this](http://ncase.me/polygons/).
