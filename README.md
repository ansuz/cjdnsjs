< randati> But I wouldn't mind if someone wanted to take over fc00. I don't have the time to keep it up

[FC00.org](http://www.fc00.org) is a tool to display the network topology of [Hyperboria](https://projectmeshnet.org/), the **premier global cjdns mesh network**.

I've been [following this project for some time](http://transitiontech.ca/graph), and I figure if [Randati](https://github.com/Randati) doesn't have the time to maintain it, I might as well have a go at it and incorporate some of the network analysis code I've been working on as a hobby.

I'm most comfortable working in Javascript, and I'm not overly fond of databases, so I plan to focus mostly on developing the clientside engine to display more general statistics about the network.

I'll be pulling stats from the various data APIs available on Hyperboria.
