I'm deleting files left over from when this was primarily a fork of fc00.org. Since they contain useful functions, but I am using a different architecture, I am first going to document what they were responsible for accomplishing.

## graphData.py

Contains the following functions:

`insert_graph_data(config, json_str)`

* tries to load the json specified into `graph_data`, and fails if it is invalid.
* instantiates a `nodes` dictionary, and an `edges` array.
* for each node in graph_data, create an entry in the nodes dictionary, accessible by ip, with attributes containing the ip and version.
* For every known edge, append to the `edges` array a tuple referencing the two endpoints of the edge.
* insert the nodes and edges into a database, and fail if there are any problems

## database.py

* define a class `NodeDB`, containing the following methods and attributes:
  + `__init__`
    + con (a database connection) which takes the following arguments.
      + MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST
      + MYSQL_DATABASE_USER
      + MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD
      + MYSQL_DATABASE_DB
    + cur (a database cursor)
  + `__enter__` (which returns the class)
  + `__exit__` (which commits changes and closes the database connection)
  + insert_node(self,node)
    + record the time of database insertion
    + insert into the database:
      + ip
      + name
      + version
      + first_seen
      + last_seen
  + insert_edge(self,edge)
    + record the time of database insertion
    + insert into the database:
      + both consituent nodes of the edge
      + time first and last seen
  + insert_graph(self,nodes,edges)
    + map `insert_node` over all nodes
    + map `insert_edge` over all edges
  + get_nodes(self, time_limit)
    + tl;dr: get all nodes from the database
  + get_edges(self,time_limit)
    + tl;dr: get all edges from the database
  + get_graph(self, time_limit)
    + a handy wrapper around get_nodes and get_edges
    + returns the complete graph

## web.py

Defines the flask app. Contains four routes:

* `/`
* `/network`
  + renders `network.html`
* `/about`
  + renders `about.html`
* `/sendGraph`
  + receives graphs from remote clients
  + processes data
  + inserts data into the database

## database.sql

+ creates the database if it does not already exist (`fc00`)
+ rewrites the table `edges`
  + `a` is a non-null, 39 character string
  + `b` is the same as `a`
  + `first_seen` is non-null, an 11 character int
  + `last_seen` is the same as `first_seen`
  + `PRIMARY KEY` is a tuple consisting of a and b
+ rewrite the table `nodes`
  + `ip` (39 chars)
  + `name` (64 chars)
  + `version` (11 char int)
  + `first_seen` (11 char int)
  + `last_seen` (11 char int)
  + `PRIMARY KEY` is `ip`
  + Uses `InnoDB`, defaults to utf-8 character encoding

## updateGraph.py

* Contains two functions:
  + generate_graph(time_limit=60*60*3) (limited to a running time of no longer than 3 hours)
    + calls `load_graph_from_db`, destructures the output from the returned tuple and assigns it to `nodes` and `edges`
    + calls `graphPlotter.position_nodes(nodes,edges)` and assigns the output to `graph`
    + calls `graphPlotter.get_graph_json(graph)` and assigns the output to `json`
    + writes the output to `static/graph.json`
  + load_graph_from_db(time_limit)
    + loads configuration from `web_config.cfg`
    + initializes `NodeDB` with the configuration as `db`
      + assign to `nodes` the output of `db.get_nodes`
      + assign to `edges` the output of `db.get_edges`
      + return a tuple containing the nodes and edges.
* Meant to be used as either a standalone script or a library. If called in standalone mode, it executes `generate_graph()`

## graphPlotter.py

Relies on the `pygraphviz` library, loaded as `pgv`.

Defines the following functions:

+ `position_nodes(nodes, edges)`
  + initialize a graph with `pgv.AGraph`, in strict mode, undirected, size `10!`.
  + adds the provided nodes and edges
  + positions the nodes with the following flags:
    + `prog=neato`
    + `args='-Gepsilon=0.0001 - Gmaxiter=100000'
  + returns the graph
+ `get_graph_json(G)`
  + iterates over all nodes, tracking the greatest number of neighbours encountered.
  + creates a dictionary `out_data` with attributes;
    + `created` (an int)
    + `nodes` (an array)
    + `edges` (another array)
  + iterates over the nodes again, computing how many neighbours it has relative to the network's maximum number of neigbours.
  + appends to `out_data.nodes` the following attributes:
    + `id`
    + `label`
    + `version`
    + `x` (determined by `position_nodes`)
    + `y` (as above)
    + `color` (a gradient dependent on its neighbour ratio)
    + `size` (also determined by `neighbour_ratio`)
  + iterates over edges, converting to json
  + return json
+ `_gradient_color(ratio, colors)`
  + translates the ratio into a position on a gradient, outputs and rgb color.

## graph.py

Defines `Node`, `Edge`  classes, and provides several useful functions:

* `_re_cjdns_ip` is a case-insensitive regular expression which checks whether a cjdns ipv6 is valid.
* `valid_cjdns_ip(ip)` is a wrapper around the regex which returns true or false
* `valid_version(version)` checks whether a version is less than 20, and throws a `ValueError` exception if there is any problem converting the provided version to an integer.
* the `Node` Class has the following methods and attributes:
  + `__init__(self, versions=None, label=None)` raises a value error if the ip or version are invalid.
    + otherwise, it initializes the ip, version, and label attributes (label is the last four hex digits of the ip if no label is provided)
  + `__lt__(self,b)` compares this node with another, and returns whether it is _less than_ the node in question.
  + `__repr__(self)` returns a representation of the node, consisting of its:
    + ip
    + version
    + label
* the `Edge` class has the following methods and attributes:
  + `__init__(self,a,b)` initializes itself by sorting `a` and `b` into an ordered tuple.
  + `__eq__(self,that)` checks whether two edges are equivalent
  + `__repr__(self)` returns a representation of the edge, consisting of the two constituent node's ips
